# StudentDatabaseSystem

## Overview
This program is a simple Java application designed to manage student data. It allows users to view, add, update, and delete student records stored in a text file. The program is user-friendly and operates through a console interface.

## Features
- **View Student Data**: Display all student records.
- **Add Student Data**: Add new student records with a unique NIM (student ID).
- **Update Student Data**: Modify existing student records based on NIM.
- **Delete Student Data**: Remove student records using NIM.
- **File Storage**: All student data is stored in a text file (`ListMahasiswa.txt`).

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Java and command line operations

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Pick an option from the menu.
3. Input Instructions.

The program will notify you of any errors, such as duplicate NIMs or if a NIM is not found.

## Note
Despite being a group project, I wrote the code all by myself! So this was something that I feel pride in. The rest of my teammates worked on the report, but for this repository, I overhauled the whole thing because it looked messy. Real messy.
